# Module-Runner
Module in VBA that enables running module in external workbooks in New Excel Instances rather than running in the current Instance. Allows the passing of a number of params to the subrutines and workbooks.

Developed specifically to have an automated Module run through every necessary automation required for the day and run it with updated params and running alongside other SAP modules concurrently.
